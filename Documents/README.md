The following contains confusion matrices, and a paper discussing my work on classification thus far. My investigation methods such as K-Means, SVD, Tangent Distance, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Network. 

Code for these methods can be found elsewhere in the repo.

As of 3/8/2021 my report is incomplete, and is expected to be completed for 4/25/2021.
