The following contains pythonic code (.ipynb) carrying out **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Neural Network**, and **Convolutional Neural Network** approaches on the MNIST dataset.

The Nerual Network code has brief general discussion of technique, methods, and code. For more in depth discussion and reporting on all methods, please see the documents folder. 

If you wish to best view the code, I suggest opening it in a local viewer like Jupyter Lab/Notebook or Collab. The github preview does not allow for latex in their markdown, and also will not allow you to skip using the table of contents.
