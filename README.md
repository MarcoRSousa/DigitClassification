# Digit Classification

The following is an introduction to classification of handwritten digits, which is a standard problem in pattern recognition. Subjects provide a brief introduction in carrying out several machine learning algorithms for classification, in addition to reporting results for test cases.

Performance for classification algorithms were measured using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [US Post Office Zip Code](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/StatLearnSparsity_files/DATA/zipcode.html) databases.

Algorithms include K-Means, SVD, Tangent Distance, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks for the purposes of classification.

The [Documents](https://github.com/MarcoRSousa/DigitClassification/tree/main/Documents) folder contains confusion matrices and a paper discussing my work on classification thus far. 
\
Code for K-Means, SVD, Tangent Distance can be found in the [MATLAB](https://github.com/MarcoRSousa/DigitClassification/tree/main/MATLAB) folder.
\
Code for K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks can be found in the [Python](https://github.com/MarcoRSousa/DigitClassification/tree/main/Python) folder.

# Future Support

This was a very exciting project. If future support were to come for the project, I'd likely do a deep dive into justifying nerual network infrastructure. Furthermore, adding Naive Bayes would be a consideration. Further peer review and continuing on maximizing C-NN performance would also be interesting.

Thank you for your read!
