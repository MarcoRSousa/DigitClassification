# DigitClassification
An investigation of classification algorithms on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [US Post Office Zip Code](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/StatLearnSparsity_files/DATA/zipcode.html) databases.

My investigation includes methods such as K-Means, SVD, Tangent Distance, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks for the purposes of classification.

The [Documents](https://github.com/MarcoRSousa/DigitClassification/tree/main/Documents) folder contains confusion matrices, and a paper discussing my work on classification thus far.
As of 3/8/2021 my report is incomplete, and is expected to be completed for 4/25/2021.

Code for K-Means, SVD, Tangent Distance can be found in the [MATLAB](https://github.com/MarcoRSousa/DigitClassification/tree/main/MATLAB) folder.

Code for K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks can be found in the [Python](https://github.com/MarcoRSousa/DigitClassification/tree/main/Python) folder.

As of 3/8/2021 my python code is incomplete. I would like to refine my C-NN code, and have yet to put together a Neural Network for classification. K-NN is completed, but messy.
